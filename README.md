# World Population


## Data

The data is from kaggle [world population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset). In this Dataset, we have Historical Population data for every Country/Territory in the world by different parameters like Area Size of the Country/Territory, Name of the Continent, Name of the Capital, Density, Population Growth Rate, Ranking based on Population, World Population Percentage, etc.

I downloaded `word_population.csv` from kaggle and uploaded it into this resporitory.

## Setup

I used week2 mini project as a template and made the following modifications: 

### 1. Update requirements.txt:
```
#script
polars
pyarrow
tabulate
```
### 2. Read data

Instead of using pd.read_csv, I use `pl.read_csv` to read `world_population.csv`


### 3. Update script.py

I updated the script.py using Polars for descriptive statistics to generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)

And I also created data visualization.

### 4. Generate report.md

Run ` make all` in terminal, I generated `report.md` automatically.
